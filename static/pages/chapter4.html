        <h1>Chapter 4: An Example of a Medieval Caslte</h1>
        <p>A popular example of a medieval castles is Warwick Castle.
            Warwick Castle was built in 1068 as a Motte and Bailey castle,
            3 years after King William conquered England.
            It was rebuilt in the 12th century in stone.
            This meant castles were not so weak to fire.
            There are round towers to defend against the mining tactic used by attackers
            to make the castle collapse, relieving pressure of the previous square corners of castles.
            Several port cullis - heavy iron gates - can be found while entering the castle's main gate,
            defending against a battering ram that could be used.
