        <h1>How and Why did Castles Change?</h1>
        <p>The main weakness of the original Motte and Bailey castles was the wood of which allowed it to be constructed so quick.
             This wood was easily flammable so the attackers could simply fire a flaming arrow.
             As a result of the vulnerability resulted in the first change: the transition from wood to stone.
